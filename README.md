### Installation

```bash
# One-line install (recommended)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FREELABEL/iris-opencode/main/install | bash

# Or as part of the full IRIS SDK
curl -fsSL https://heyiris.io/install-iris.sh | bash
```

> [!NOTE]
> IRIS Code is a customized fork of [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode), optimized for the IRIS platform.

### What is IRIS Code?

IRIS Code is an AI-powered coding assistant that runs in your terminal. It can:
- Read, write, and execute code autonomously
- Work with multiple AI providers (Claude, GPT, local models)
- Integrate seamlessly with the IRIS SDK and platform

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install --cask opencode-desktop
```

#### Installation Directory

The install script respects the following priority order for the installation path:

1. `$OPENCODE_INSTALL_DIR` - Custom installation directory
2. `$XDG_BIN_DIR` - XDG Base Directory Specification compliant path
3. `$HOME/bin` - Standard user binary directory (if exists or can be created)
4. `$HOME/.opencode/bin` - Default fallback

```bash
# Examples
OPENCODE_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
XDG_BIN_DIR=$HOME/.local/bin curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
```

### Agents

OpenCode includes two built-in agents you can switch between,
you can switch between these using the `Tab` key.

- **build** - Default, full access agent for development work
- **plan** - Read-only agent for analysis and code exploration
  - Denies file edits by default
  - Asks permission before running bash commands
  - Ideal for exploring unfamiliar codebases or planning changes

Also, included is a **general** subagent for complex searches and multistep tasks.
This is used internally and can be invoked using `@general` in messages.

### Building on OpenCode

If you are working on a project that's related to OpenCode and is using "opencode" as a part of its name; for example, "opencode-dashboard" or "opencode-mobile", please add a note to your README to clarify that it is not built by the OpenCode team and is not affiliated with us in any way.

### FAQ

#### How is this different from Claude Code?

It's very similar to Claude Code in terms of capability. Here are the key differences:

- 100% open source
- Not coupled to any provider. Although we recommend the models we provide through [OpenCode Zen](https://opencode.ai/zen); OpenCode can be used with Claude, OpenAI, Google or even local models. As models evolve the gaps between them will close and pricing will drop so being provider-agnostic is important.
- Out of the box LSP support
- A focus on TUI. OpenCode is built by neovim users and the creators of [terminal.shop](https://terminal.shop); we are going to push the limits of what's possible in the terminal.
- A client/server architecture. This for example can allow OpenCode to run on your computer, while you can drive it remotely from a mobile app. Meaning that the TUI frontend is just one of the possible clients.

#### What's the other repo?

The other confusingly named repo has no relation to this one. You can [read the story behind it here](https://x.com/thdxr/status/1933561254481666466).
